# RNA-seq-Tutorial
Welcome to the RNA-seq-Tutorial!

In this tutorial, I will explain a very basic tutorial for my RNA-seq analysis pipeline starting from gathering FASTQ files from ENA repositories to data visualization including knowledge about next generation sequence, file formats, quality checks, reference genomes, gene annotation, expression analysis, differential expression analysis.

To actually complete and read details of this tutorial, go to the [rnaseq_tutorial wiki](https://github.com/CilgaIscan/RNA-seq-Tutorial/wiki).
